## Scaling Strategy

### Application Tier
1. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Trigger: CPU > 70% or Memory > 80%
   - Action: Add pods in increments of 2
   - Max pods: 20

2. **Vertical Scaling**
   - Trigger: Pod CPU > 85% or Memory > 90%
   - Action: Increase resources by 25%
   - Max resources per pod: 8 cores, 16GB

### Database Tier
1. **Read Scaling**
   - Trigger: Read IOPS > 2000/s
   - Action: Add read replica
   - Max replicas: 3

2. **Write Scaling**
   - Trigger: Write IOPS > 1000/s
   - Action: Increase instance size
   - Max size: db.r6g.4xlarge

### Cache Tier
1. **Memory Scaling**
   - Trigger: Memory usage > 80% or Eviction rate > 1%
   - Action: Increase cache size by 25%
   - Max size: 128GB

2. **Shard Scaling**
   - Trigger: Connections > 4000

## Risk Analysis

### Technical Risks
1. **Database Performance**
   - Risk: Write bottleneck during peak hours
   - Mitigation: Implement write sharding
   - Timeline: Q2 2025

2. **Network Bandwidth**
   - Risk: Bandwidth saturation during media uploads
   - Mitigation: Implement CDN for media delivery
   - Timeline: Q1 2025

3. **Cache Capacity**
   - Risk: High eviction rate during peak hours
   - Mitigation: Implement tiered caching
   - Timeline: Q2 2025

### Business Risks
1. **Cost Escalation**
   - Risk: Infrastructure costs growing faster than revenue
   - Mitigation: Implement cost optimization and monitoring
   - Timeline: Ongoing

2. **Performance Degradation**
   - Risk: User experience impact during scaling
   - Mitigation: Implement auto-scaling and load testing
   - Timeline: Q1 2025
