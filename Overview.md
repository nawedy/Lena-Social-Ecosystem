TikTokToe: A Revolutionary Social Media Platform

Goal: Redefine user interactions, privacy, and content creation.
Target: Surpass TikTok and Instagram.
Key Differentiators:
Cutting-edge AI
Superior Technology
Enhanced User Experience
AT Protocol Integration
Focus: Scalability, reduced dependency conflicts, best practices.
It's clear that we need to get back on track and make sure our development efforts are aligned with this vision.

Addressing the Lingering "Game" Issue:

To fully address the "silly game" issue and ensure a clean project, we need to take these steps:

Thorough Codebase Review: We need to do a complete review of the entire codebase to find and eliminate any remaining references to the game concept. This includes:
Code comments
Variable names
File names
Function names
Configuration files
Documentation
Documentation Update: All documentation (including READMEs, user guides, and design documents) must be reviewed and updated to reflect the social media platform concept.
Dependency Check: We should review our dependencies to make sure we're not including any unnecessary libraries or frameworks related to the game.
Remove unecessary files: We need to remove files and folders that are not relevant to the project.
Immediate Action Plan:

Codebase Cleanup: I will start by listing all the project files, and trying to identify any remnants of the "game".
Documentation Cleanup: Review the existing documentation and propose changes.
Prioritized Development Focus (Revised):

Now that we're back on track, let's reiterate the core development priorities, in alignment with the social media platform vision:

Core Social Media Features:
User profiles
Content creation and sharing (text, images, videos)
Following/followers
Commenting/likes/reactions
Direct messaging
Content discovery (feeds, trending topics)
AT Protocol Integration:
Seamless integration with the AT Protocol for decentralized identity and social graph.
Ensure all core social features are leveraging AT Protocol.
AI Features:
Content recommendation algorithms
Content moderation
User personalization
Security and Privacy:
End-to-end encryption
Data security and user privacy best practices
Robust security measures to protect against attacks
User Migration:
TikTok Migration: Make sure this feature is fully functional and works as intended.
Scalability:
Design the platform for scalability from the ground up.
Ensure that core systems can handle a large influx of users.
User Experience:
Intuitive and engaging user interface
Smooth performance and responsiveness
Accessible design
