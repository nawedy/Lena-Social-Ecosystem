Frontend: React-based web application.
Mobile: React Native mobile application.
Backend: API and services likely built with Node.js/Express, with strong indicators of TypeScript usage.
Database: PostgreSQL, with potential use of Redis for caching.
Infrastructure: Kubernetes (k8s), Docker, possibly Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for deployment.
Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, Elasticsearch, Kibana.
Testing: Jest, Playwright, Detox (for mobile E2E).
CI/CD: Cloud Build
Beta features: Extensive beta testing infrastructure.
ATProtocol: integration with ATProtocol for social media aspects
Development Plan to Production Deployment
Phase 1: Code Consolidation and Stabilization (2-4 Weeks)
Goal: Ensure code quality, consistency, and stability across all parts of the project.
Code Review:
Perform thorough code reviews to identify and fix bugs, enforce coding standards, and improve code readability.
Focus on complex areas like ATProtocol integration, database interactions, and API routes.
Address any outstanding TODOs or FIXMEs.
Dependency Management:
Review package.json files (frontend, mobile, root) to ensure dependencies are up-to-date and secure.
Identify and address any known vulnerabilities.
Consolidate duplicate dependencies where possible.
Linting and Formatting:
Enforce consistent linting rules using ESLint and consider using Rome for formatting.
Fix all linting errors and warnings.
Run fix-lint.sh, fix-common-lint.sh, and fix-typescript.sh scripts.
Refactoring:
Refactor any overly complex or poorly organized code.
Look for opportunities to extract common logic into reusable modules or utility functions.
Security Review:
Review code for potential security vulnerabilities, such as injection attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS), and authentication issues.
Ensure sensitive data (e.g., API keys, database credentials) is handled securely and not hardcoded.
Expected Outcomes: Clean code base, consistent coding style, no critical errors or security issues, improved performance.
Phase 2: Robust Testing (2-4 Weeks)
Goal: Implement and expand testing to ensure high quality and reliability.
Unit Testing:
Write comprehensive unit tests for services, utilities, and components.
Aim for high code coverage, especially in critical areas.
Run jest to execute all tests.
Integration Testing:
Write integration tests to verify interactions between different components and services, such as database interactions and API calls.
Focus on testing the ATProtocol, API routes, and other complex features.
E2E Testing:
Expand the existing E2E tests (Playwright for web, Detox for mobile).
Cover critical user flows like login, posting content, searching, and profile management.
Performance Testing:
Use the src/utils/performance-benchmark.ts and src/utils/performance-optimizer.ts files to measure and improve performance.
Implement load testing using src/testing/load/LoadTestService.ts.
Ensure src/utils/cost-optimizer.ts is correctly configured to manage costs.
Chaos Testing:
Use src/testing/chaos/ChaosTestService.ts to simulate failures and test resilience.
Expected Outcomes: Reduced bug count, stable code base, high confidence in code quality, identified performance bottlenecks.
Phase 3: Infrastructure and Deployment Preparation (2-4 Weeks)
Goal: Prepare infrastructure and deployment process for production.
Infrastructure Review:
Examine Terraform (infrastructure/main.tf) and Kubernetes files (k8s/) to ensure they match production needs.
Verify proper resource allocation, scalability, and security configurations.
Check service dependencies (config/gcp/).
Database Management:
Review database schemas (src/db/migrations/) and ensure they're production-ready.
Implement robust database backup (scripts/backup-db.sh) and recovery procedures.
Implement database scaling policies scripts/manage_scaling.sh.
Setup the database with scripts/setup-cloud-sql.sh and scripts/setup-db.js
Containerization:
Ensure the Dockerfile is optimized for production.
Build and test production-ready container images.
Ensure docker-compose.yml and docker-compose.db.yml are configured for production.
Monitoring Setup:
Configure Prometheus rules (config/prometheus/rules/) and Grafana dashboards (config/grafana/dashboards/) for production.
Set up alerts for critical metrics and errors.
Examine the setup for logging (config/logrotate/app-logs, config/filebeat/filebeat.yml, config/logstash/) and ensure it's adequate for production debugging.
CI/CD Pipeline:
Configure the CI/CD pipeline (likely Cloud Build via cloudbuild.yaml) to run tests, build containers, and deploy to a staging environment.
Implement automated deployments to staging upon each merge to main.
Secrets management:
Ensure secure secret management is implemented.
Expected Outcomes: Scalable infrastructure, robust deployment process, working CI/CD, production-ready container images.
Phase 4: Staging and Pre-production (2 Weeks)
Goal: Test and validate the entire system in a staging environment.
Staging Deployment:
Deploy the application to a staging environment that mirrors production as closely as possible.
Run all tests (unit, integration, E2E) in staging.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT):
Invite a select group of testers to use the staging environment and provide feedback.
Fix any identified issues.
Performance Testing and Optimization:
Conduct load testing and performance testing in staging to ensure the system can handle expected traffic.
Optimize as needed based on performance results.
Adjust auto-scaling policies (src/utils/auto-scaling.ts, scripts/manage_scaling.sh) based on results.
Security Audit:
Perform a thorough security audit of the staging environment.
Fix any vulnerabilities found.
Expected Outcomes: Stable and performant staging environment, successful UAT, optimized system, final security review.
Phase 5: Production Rollout (1-2 Weeks)
Goal: Deploy to production with minimal disruption and risk.
Production Deployment:
Deploy to production using a gradual rollout strategy (e.g., canary deployment) to minimize risk.
Use the established CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment.
Monitoring and Alerting:
Closely monitor production environment for errors, performance issues, and unexpected behavior.
Respond to any alerts promptly.
Rollback Plan:
Prepare a clear rollback plan in case issues arise during or after deployment.
Post-Deployment Review:
Conduct a post-deployment review to identify areas for improvement in the process.
Expected Outcomes: Successful production deployment, stable application, minimal downtime, effective monitoring and alerting.
Key Considerations and Potential Challenges:
ATProtocol Integration: This is a potentially complex integration. Testing and thorough understanding of the protocol are critical.
Database Migrations: Careful planning is needed for database migrations (src/db/migrations/) to avoid data loss or downtime.
Mobile App Updates: Coordinating mobile app updates with backend changes.
Security: Robust security practices are crucial.
Monitoring: Effective monitoring is essential for detecting and addressing issues quickly.
Beta Testing Infrastructure: Leveraging the beta testing capabilities for continuous improvement.
Scalability: Ensuring the system can handle growing traffic.
Cost optimization: This project has a wide variety of costs to manage so having a solid strategy using src/utils/cost-optimizer.ts and src/monitoring/cost-monitor.ts is very important.
