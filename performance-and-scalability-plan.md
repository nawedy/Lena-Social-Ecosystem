# Performance and Scalability Plan

This document outlines the plan for performance optimization and scalability improvements for the TikTokToe project.

## Phase 1: Performance Optimization

The primary goal of this phase is to enhance the application's performance by addressing key areas identified in the architecture documentation (`docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md`).  We will also consider the business risks related to performance degradation outlined in `docs/capacity/capacity-forecast.md`, specifically addressing auto-scaling and load testing in Q1 2025.

**1. Caching Strategy:**

*   Implement multi-level caching using:
    *   In-memory caching (Redis): Leverage Redis for caching frequently accessed data.  Address the risk of high eviction rate during peak hours (Q2 2025) by implementing tiered caching, as noted in the capacity forecast.
    *   Browser caching: Configure appropriate caching headers to leverage browser caching.
    *   CDN caching: Utilize a CDN to cache static assets and improve content delivery.  This mitigates the risk of bandwidth saturation during media uploads (Q1 2025).
    *   Application-level caching: Implement caching at the application level for specific data or API responses.

**2. Performance Optimization Techniques:**

*   Code splitting: Break down the application into smaller chunks to reduce initial load time.
*   Lazy loading: Load components and resources only when they are needed.
*   Image optimization: Optimize images to reduce their size without compromising quality.
*   Bundle optimization: Minimize the size of the application bundle to improve loading speed.  This should be completed in week 2-3 of the beta testing timeline as per BETA_RELEASE.md.

## Phase 2: Scalability Enhancements

This phase focuses on improving the application's scalability to handle increased user traffic and data volume.  It also considers the technical risks outlined in `docs/capacity/capacity-forecast.md`.

**1. Horizontal Scaling:**

*   Auto-scaling policies: Implement auto-scaling policies to dynamically adjust resources based on demand.  Consider using Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) as suggested by the presence of k8s configuration files. This addresses the mitigation for performance degradation during scaling, expected in Q1 2025.
*   Load balancing: Distribute traffic across multiple instances to prevent overload.  Load testing (Q1 2025) will help determine the necessary load balancing configurations.
*   Distributed caching: Utilize distributed caching to scale caching capabilities.  The tiered caching strategy (Q2 2025) will contribute to this.
*   Microservices architecture: Evaluate the feasibility of transitioning to a microservices architecture.

**2. Data Scaling:**

*   Database sharding: Implement database sharding to distribute data across multiple database instances. This is planned for Q2 2025 to mitigate the risk of database write bottlenecks.
*   Read replicas: Utilize read replicas to handle read-heavy workloads.
*   Data partitioning: Partition data based on relevant criteria to improve query performance.
*   Query optimization: Optimize database queries to improve efficiency.

## Phase 3: Security Monitoring

This phase enhances the security posture by implementing robust monitoring and alerting capabilities. It incorporates the resource metrics from `docs/capacity/capacity-forecast.md` and the incident response procedures from `BETA_RELEASE.md`.

**1. Security Monitoring:**
*   Real-time threat detection: Implement a system for real-time threat detection and alerting.  Integrate this with the incident classification system and response team contacts outlined in the emergency procedures.
*   Automated vulnerability scanning: Regularly scan the application for vulnerabilities.
*   Security event logging: Log security-related events for auditing and analysis.
*   Incident response system: Establish an incident response system to handle security incidents, following the rollback procedures, communication templates, and escalation paths defined in the emergency procedures.
*   Resource Monitoring: Set up alerts for resource metrics.
    *  CPU Utilization: Warning at 70%, Critical at 85%
    *  Memory Utilization: Warning at 75%, Critical at 90%

## Phase 4: Cost Optimization

Finally, optimize infrastructure costs based on the insights gained from the implemented performance optimizations, scaling enhancements, and security monitoring.  Consider the ongoing cost escalation risk from `docs/capacity/capacity-forecast.md`.

**1. Cost Optimization Strategies:**

*   Analyze cloud resource utilization: Use cost monitoring tools to analyze resource usage.  This should be an ongoing task to address the cost escalation risk.
*   Implement cost-saving measures: Implement appropriate cost-saving measures based on the analysis, leveraging tools like `src/utils/cost-optimizer.ts` and `src/monitoring/cost-monitor.ts`.
*   Continuously monitor and optimize: Continuously monitor cloud costs and optimize infrastructure as needed. This aligns with the ongoing cost optimization timeline.

This plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for performance optimization, scalability enhancements, security monitoring, and cost optimization.  It prioritizes these tasks appropriately and considers the interdependencies between them. The plan also incorporates relevant information from other project documents to create a more cohesive and actionable strategy.  The specific implementation details will be further elaborated during the development process.
